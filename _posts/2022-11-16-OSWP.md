# Offensive Security Wireless Professional

I took this test based on having time on my Learn One subscription. I was pleasently suprised how much of this I was capable if picking up. It wasnt difficult, and very proceedural. I did buy a wifi router to practice with and I ran through the general process three or four times. I took the test two weeks after I took the OSCP, and I passed it with an hour to spare. Follow the pdf and you will be fine.
