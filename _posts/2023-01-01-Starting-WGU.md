# Starting WGU

I decided last year that I needed to go back to school in order to advance my career. After a lot of research I determied that WGU is where I want to be, and have enrolled. The great thing about WGU is the ability to transfer in certifications ans ACE classes. So I signed up with a start date six months into the future, received a transfer list from my existing associates degree, and started plugging on Sophia.com for credits I would need. 

I took care of everything sophia could offer on my degree track and switched gears to study.com. I managed to knock out 4 classes over two weeks (including grade times). I still have a couple of days remaining, and may consider going after a cloud essentials certification while my brain is still buzzing.
