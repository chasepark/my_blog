# Comptia Cloud Essentials + 

I decided to take this course out of boredom and wanting to jump on getting my WGU transcripts flush with hours. This seemed harmless and I wanted something cloud agnostic, but WGU uses the Amazon Certified Cloud Practitioner exam, a great exam, but I work primarily with Azure. So I decided to take this test on a Tuesday, and sat the exam on the following Wednesday. Here are my takeaways:
- Understand Compita definitions versus real-world definitions.
- Understand that business and technical decisions are seperate, and understand what answer the questions are looking for.
- Have a decent grasp on CapEx vs OpEx.

Overall I'm happy to have another class out of the way. Now I have a voucher for the AZ-400 which I will take before I jump into my WGU classes.
